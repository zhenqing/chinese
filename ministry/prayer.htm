            <h3>祷告 for World 宣教事工s </h3>
            <p><span class="phrase">Matthew 28:19-20</span></p>
            <p class="italic">"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."</p>
            <p>Before Jesus ascended into heaven, He gave a charge to all His disciples to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth until He would return the second time. With those words, He left the earth and entrusted the work of spreading the Gospel to His disciples and to all who would obey Him.</p>
			<p>As Young Disciples of Jesus, we wish to be the ones to obey this great commission given by God to us. We believe that the work of the church is not primarily self-preservation; we believe that the Lord has called us to share the good news of the Gospel to every nation, tribe and tongue. Truly, it is by grace that we are given this chance to go to all the ends of the earth to witness the love of the Lord that has been given to us so unconditionally. We hope to hold on to our callings well as one body in Christ.</p>
			<p class="phrase">Acts: 1:8</p>
			<p class="italic">"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem , and in all Judea and Samaria , and to the ends of the earth."</p>
			<p>It is not by might, nor by power, but it is by the power of the Spirit of God that we are missionaries who carry the responsibility to spread the gospel to all corners of the earth. Therefore, the spirit-filled missionaries of our ministry aim to ignite the same passion and fire within the hearts of souls that are longing for the truth of life. With each step we take, we are following the guidance of the Holy Spirit, making sure that we are walking in the will of the Lord. Although we make plans and goals, it is ultimately the Lord who directs our path. Whether it is to Jerusalem , Judea or Samaria , it is our willingness to go wherever the Lord leads.</p>
			<p>Just like Christ revealed the perfect love of our Father God, we offer our prayers and lower ourselves to serve the will of God so that many lost souls can be found.  </p>
            <h3>Prayer for the Unreached</h3>
            <p class="phrase">Romans 10:14 </p>
            <p class="italic">"How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?" </p><p>How important is it that we preach the word of God to the people in parts of the world where the light has not been? We who have been given the truth of life not by our deeds but by the grace of God are responsible to share the blessings of God with every one including the people that we don't know. Out of the overflowing love of the cross which the Lord has poured in our hearts, Young Disciples of Jesus is convicted to go beyond all boundaries to reach the unreached. </p>
            <p class="phrase">Romans 8:39 </p>
            <p class="italic">"Neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord." </p>
            <p>As the scriptures taught us, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, can separate us from the love of God. This also applies to mission obstacles such as language barriers, culture differences, financial difficulties and other obstruction that the enemy has built to block the children of God from returning home. But if God is for us, who can be against us? (Romans 8:31) Therefore, it is of utmost importance that we should continuously pray for the unreached people of the world.  </p>
            <h3>Prayer for Student Campuses  </h3>
            <p class="bold" >"There are about 3,000 colleges in the United States . There are about 25, 000 around the world. Despite the efforts of so many groups, more than a third of the world's college campuses do not have any contact with full-time Christian workers."<br />– Patricia Burgin, author of The Powerful Percent</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, the harvest is plenty but the laborers are few. The Bible calls Christians to be aware of the urgency for evangelism. By this teaching, students of the Young Disciples of Jesus are motivated to reach out to student campuses. Our purpose and mission is to share with the students about the eternal water that we've received from the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  </p>
            <p>Being the most densely populated place in the community, the student campus is overflowing with young people from different backgrounds who came with the longing to learn something meaningful. How blessed will their lives be if the void in the hearts is filled with the good news of the gospel? We are the ones who have received this gift of life by the grace of God and thus we want to express our gratitude by sharing the same gift with other souls that are hungry for the truth.</p>
            <p>Even if there is only one soul who responds to the gospel, it is worth all our efforts in mission because it was Lord Jesus who demonstrated this kind of unconditional love throughout His ministry on earth. As followers and disciples of Jesus, we ought to live our lives according to His ways.</p>
            <p>Our prayer is that through missions to student campuses, YD can bring many darkened lives into light.</p>
            <p class="phrase">John 8:32</p>
            <p class="italic">"Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."</p>
            <h3>Prayer for Student Leaders </h3>
            <p class="phrase">1 Timothy 4:12 </p>
            <p class="italic" >"Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity." </p>
            <pOne of the goals of Young Disciples of Jesus is to raise student leaders and train them to become influential shepherds for His kingdom. The youths of this generation are crucial members of the body of Christ. They will be the ones to make a difference in the mission fields including universities and colleges. Being young at heart and body youths have the capacity to quickly adapt and learn not just the skills required for leadership but they also possess open hearts towards God and His will.  </p>
            <p class="phrase">Proverbs 20:29</p>
            <p class="italic">"The glory of young men is their strength, gray hair the splendor of the old." </p>
            <p>Having the physical strength and energy, every student ought to lead lives like that of Lord Jesus Christ so that other youths can see God through us. Offering our lives as a living testimony to the unbelievers, we want to witness God's love to them through our lifestyle. Speaking edifying words and carrying each other's burdens, we hope to be fruitful in love and multiply. We constantly pray for the building of future leaders and giving glory to the Lord in His mission across the world.  </p>
